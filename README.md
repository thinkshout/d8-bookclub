# ThinkShout's D8 Bookclub

D8's coming, so we're learning. This repository will serve as a home for our code home work, and, more importantly, for any lessons learned in our weekly review sessions. There's a folder for each lesson, with a top level README of any lessons learned. As much as is reasonable, everyone will add their code from the lesson in their own subfolder under each lesson. E.g.,

```
#1 Hello World
  -- Gabe
     hello_world.info.yml
     hello_world.module
     README
  -- Joe
  ...
```
