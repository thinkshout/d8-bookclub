# Amy's Blog Homework
---
## Synopsis
* The UI for creating the blog and view were very straight forward and similar to how these are created in Drupal 7.
* The biggest challenge for me was not the exporting of configuration files via `admin/config/development/configuration`, but it was the packaging up of the configuration in a way that Drupal 8 recognized.
* The top resource was, perhaps, the most helpful

## Questions: 
* _Sites own their configuration, not modules. - Alex Pott_  <-- would like to discuss what this means... Isn't configuration stored in modules?
* Why isn't this more straightforward or documented? Seems like there's an opportunity here for us to assist the Drupal community...
