##Trouble
- Could not create content type with drupal console, only content entity, whatever that is. Did through UI.
- Tedious UI config export, easy to miss dependencies — didn’t have time to figure out better way.
- Probably would not have figured out how to create reusable module without Joe and Nancy’s code.
- Does not uninstall cleanly? Schema?

##Discoveries?
- Dependencies in each config file helpful
- Block context export
