Creating subtheme from Classy was easy from documentation of Drupal.org. 
I was able to add CSS - though I sort of wish I'd chosen a base theme with a bit more styling. 
Learning about the debug setting in the sites/default/service.yml file was awesome! 
I could not get auto_load = true or cache = false to work though, but being able to dump variables was helpful. 

Two Lullabot articles helped a bunch.
