Themeing introductory lesson:
Concepts:
- Theme structure in D8
- Twig syntax

Task:
- Create a custom subtheme for your site, and activate it.
- Override the display of your blog layout to do something different from the way other nodes are displayed (Example: Display an "Author" field value instead of the "Author" property.)
