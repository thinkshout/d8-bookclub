## Joe

- drupal-composer/drupal8 on GitHub https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project
- used a guide on d.o.

## Nancy
- Downloaded zip file and ran the installer through the UI
- Made a configurable block

## Amy
- Cloned D8 repo, create database in SQL pro status problems
- Drupal being on wrong branch

## Jaymz
- Also used composer, similar to Joe
- Installed via `drush si`
- Composer put everything into the web directory
- Installed php twig extension in Homebrew
- Used Drupal console to create the module

## Jami
- Used ts_build: Tried to run build.sh, but it never ran clean

## Eric
- Status screen: issue with GD library PNG support
- Tried to get a dynamic route to work
- Felt comfortable with MVC route

## Greg
- Enabled configuration in files.
- Discovered that blocks are not deployable with CMI.
- Discovered the configuration is not reusable.
- Discovered that there's no obvious way to deploy UUIDs or create new UUIDs.
- Also discovered that configuration is easily broken which gives unrelated PHP errors.

## Gabe
- Did not follow a template, tried to build a “minimal” module from scratch
- Module files are optional, not officially

## General Issues
- Permissions issue with sites/default and settings.php. Drupal keeps taking away the owners write permission.
- PHP max nesting level is too low
- Trusted host settings
